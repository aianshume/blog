title: About
---

I'm Devin Schulz, a software developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I specialize in
building web applications that are performant, accessible, and focused on the
user experience.

My professional journey started as a freelance graphic designer who loved to
code. During my time as a freelancer, I transitioned from telling people how the
designs look and operate to the one implementing them.

I chose to end my freelance venture after deciding I wanted something a little
more permanent. Pursuing clients and ensuring you always have work lined up is
**exhausting**. I ended up joining [Soshal](https://soshal.ca/), a humble agency
that I had once worked with on a couple projects.

A year and a half year went by, and I transitioned to working remotely at
[InVision](https://invisionapp.com), for what was my longest stint. I watched
and helped the company grow from 76 people to well over 800. I had the
opportunity to build out useful features and products like
[Marketplace](https://marketplace.invisionapp.com/),
[Design Disruptors](https://www.designdisruptors.com/),
[Boards](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/),
[Inspect](https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/inspect/),
[Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft), and most recently, everything
related to comments.

As of May 2020, I took a lead role in helping
[Cape Privacy](https://capeprivacy.com) build a platform for data scientists
which marries privacy and machine learning. I defined the front end
architecture, and currently building out the core product.

I hope the content I share can provide you, the reader, with first-hand
knowledge. I look forward to delivering suggestions and approaches that everyone
can benefit from.

I'm happy to have you along for the ride!

&mdash; Devin

  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I'm Devin Schulz, a software developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I specialize
    in building web applications that are performant, accessible, and focused on
    the user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    My professional journey started as a freelance graphic designer who loved to
    code. During my time as a freelancer, I transitioned from telling people how
    the designs look and operate to the one implementing them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I chose to end my freelance venture after deciding I wanted something a
    little more permanent. Pursuing clients and ensuring you always have work
    lined up is
    <strong>exhausting</strong>
    . I ended up joining
    <a href="https://soshal.ca/" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Soshal</a>
    , a humble agency that I had once worked with on a couple projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    A year and a half year went by, and I transitioned to working remotely at
    <a href="https://invisionapp.com" rel="external noopener noreferrer">
      InVision
    </a>
    , for what was my longest stint. I watched and helped the company grow from
    76 people to well over 800. I had the opportunity to build out useful
    features and products like
    <a
      href="https://marketplace.invisionapp.com/"
      rel="external noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Marketplace
    </a>
    ,
    <a
      href="https://www.designdisruptors.com"
      rel="external noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Design Disruptors
    </a>
    ,
    <a
      href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets"
      rel="external noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Boards
    </a>
    ,
    <a
      href="https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/inspect"
      rel="external noopener noreferrer"

      href="https://www.invisionapp.com/craft"

    </a>
    , and most recently, everything related to comments.
  </p>

  <p>
    As of May 2020, I took a lead role in helping
    <a href="https://capeprivacy.com" rel="external noopener noreferrer">
      Cape Privacy
    </a>
    build a platform for data scientists which marries privacy and machine
    learning. I defined the front end architecture, and currently building out
    the core product.
